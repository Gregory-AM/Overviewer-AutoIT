# Overviewer-AutoIT
This repo was made specifically for a software that I am currently developing.  
The files are not your typical AutoIT extensions, they are A3X.  
They have specific functions within them that are only triggered by the GUI that downloads them from here.  
The functions are not typical words.  
  
## What is it for?
  
The software is an add-on to **"[The Minecraft Overviewer](https://overviewer.org)"**.  
It is being made to simplify the process of creating Isometric Maps.  
I understand I could create this software with a better resource.  
However, I chose to use a language I know well.
